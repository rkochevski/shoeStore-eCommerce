							<span class="bold">PRIVACY STATEMENT</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">Your privacy is very important to us. </span>This
							policy is intended to give you a clear understanding about Shoe
							Store, Inc. ("Shoe Store") practices regarding collection,
							use, and disclosure of information that you may provide online or
							in our stores. This Privacy Statement applies to the information
							collected at any of our stores, on our website, and through your
							membership in our SHOE PERKS Rewards Club Program. Please be sure
							to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting
							information online or in our stores.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">About Children</span>
						</p>
						<p>This site is not intended for children under the age of 13.
							We will not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable
							information via this site from visitors in this age group. We
							encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of
							the Internet and the information they disclose to web sites.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">1. Passive Information Collected</span>
						</p>
						<p>As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous
							information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without
							your actively providing the information) using various
							technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and
							navigational data collection (log files, server logs,
							clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to
							this site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of
							the web site you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP)
							address and the browser version your computer is currently using.
							This site may also collect anonymous information from your
							computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You
							may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to
							refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site may
							not work without cookies.</p>
						<p>We use marketing consultants to help us maintain and
							analyze our data and allow us to market more efficiently. They
							may use cookies or web beacons to collect information about you,
							in connection with providing you information via email, Internet
							ads or direct mail about products and services that might be of
							interest to you. You can choose not to have this information used
							by our trusted third party advertising partners by contacting us
							to opt out.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">2. Personal Information You Provide</span>
						</p>
						<p>Shoe Store may ask you to submit personally identifiable
							information so that you can benefit from the specified features
							(such as online purchases, in-store purchases, order tracking,
							creating/updating a shoecarnival.com account, submitting a
							product review, joining the SHOE PERKS Rewards Program and resume
							submission) or to participate in a particular activity (such as
							sweepstakes, surveys or other promotions). You will be informed
							what information is required and what information is optional.</p>
						<p>Categories of personal information you may provide include
							name, shipping address, billing address, telephone number, email
							address, credit card information, order information, SHOE PERKS
							Rewards Program member number, recipient's name and email address
							(if applicable).</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">Use and Disclosure of Personal
								Information</span>
						</p>
						<p>Shoe Store may use information collected from you online
							and in stores to:</p>
						<ul class="lists">
							<li>process and deliver products you have ordered;</li>
							<li>communicate changes in your order status;</li>
							<li>process your return or exchange;</li>
							<li>customize the site to your preferences and tailor
								products marketed to you;</li>
							<li>respond to your inquiries;</li>
							<li>provide information to SHOE PERKS Rewards Program
								members; and</li>
							<li>collect and process your payments.</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p>We offer gift cards for purchase. Information you provide
							to us to create a gift card is only used for that purpose, and is
							only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.</p>
						<p>If you choose to create or update a shoecarnival.com
							account, you may save personal information in that account, to
							include name, shipping and billing addresses, and credit card
							information. This option is intended to streamline your shopping
							experience as it allows us to access your pre-saved information
							at checkout rather than entering the information for each online
							order.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">Information We Share With Third Parties</span>
						</p>
						<p>Shoe Store uses third parties to support our business
							and provide services such as receiving, processing and fulfilling
							orders, encrypting credit card data as a further measure of
							securing the data, processing credit card payments, processing
							product reviews, technical support, and providing comparative
							performance information relative to our site.</p>
						<p>We may disclose the personally identifiable information
							that you have provided to us to third parties, but only:</p>
						<p>(i) to contractors we use to support our business (such as
							fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services,
							affiliated partners and financial institutions), in which case we
							will require such third parties to agree to treat your personal
							information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for
							the same purposes;</p>
						<p>(ii) in connection with the sale, assignment, merger or
							other transfer of the business of this site to which the
							information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer
							to agree to treat your personal information in accordance with
							this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes; or</p>
						<p>(iii) to respond to law enforcement requests or where
							required by applicable laws, court orders, or government
							regulations.</p>
						<p>If you choose to complete a product review, you will submit
							the review and the personal information that you choose to submit
							along with your review to a third party with whom we have
							contracted to accept, collect and manage the reviews. Any product
							review that you submit may be published by us on this website, in
							printed or television advertisements, or in emails. You may
							choose what, if any, personal information you elect to submit in
							your product review, such as your name or a nickname and
							location. The information you choose to submit as personal
							identification with your review may be published with your review
							in the manner described above.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">Updating Personal Information and
								Opt-Out </span>
						</p>
						<p>To keep personal information that you provide online or in
							stores accurate, current, and complete, please log-in to your
							shoecarnival.com account to update or modify your information, or
							contact us as specified below.</p>
						<p>If at any point you would prefer to opt-out or reduce the
							frequency of promotional email, including email associated with
							SHOE PERKS Rewards Program, or mailings, please update your
							contact preferences on your shoecarnival.com account or follow
							the removal instructions in each message.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">Security</span>

						<p>Shoe Store takes reasonable steps to protect personally
							identifiable information as you transmit it to our site and to
